# LEETCODE-Array-1608
Let's go through a dry run of the `specialArray` method to understand how it works. This method is supposed to find a special integer `x` such that exactly `x` numbers in the array `nums` are greater than or equal to `x`. If no such integer exists, it returns `-1`.

Consider the example array `nums = [3, 5, 6, 7, 2]`.

### Step-by-Step Dry Run

1. **Initialization**: The method starts with a `for` loop iterating `x` from `1` to `nums.length` (inclusive). In this example, `nums.length` is `5`.

2. **Iteration with `x = 1`**:
    - Initialize `cnt` to `0`.
    - Iterate over each element in `nums`:
        - `3 >= 1` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 1`
        - `5 >= 1` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 2`
        - `6 >= 1` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 3`
        - `7 >= 1` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 4`
        - `2 >= 1` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 5`
    - At the end of the loop, `cnt

Let's complete the dry run for the given array `nums = [3, 5, 6, 7, 2]`.

### Step-by-Step Dry Run

1. **Initialization**: The method starts with a `for` loop iterating `x` from `1` to `nums.length` (inclusive). In this example, `nums.length` is `5`.

2. **Iteration with `x = 1`**:
    - Initialize `cnt` to `0`.
    - Iterate over each element in `nums`:
        - `3 >= 1` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 1`
        - `5 >= 1` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 2`
        - `6 >= 1` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 3`
        - `7 >= 1` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 4`
        - `2 >= 1` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 5`
    - At the end of the loop, `cnt = 5` which is not equal to `x = 1`, so move to the next iteration.

3. **Iteration with `x = 2`**:
    - Initialize `cnt` to `0`.
    - Iterate over each element in `nums`:
        - `3 >= 2` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 1`
        - `5 >= 2` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 2`
        - `6 >= 2` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 3`
        - `7 >= 2` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 4`
        - `2 >= 2` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 5`
    - At the end of the loop, `cnt = 5` which is not equal to `x = 2`, so move to the next iteration.

4. **Iteration with `x = 3`**:
    - Initialize `cnt` to `0`.
    - Iterate over each element in `nums`:
        - `3 >= 3` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 1`
        - `5 >= 3` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 2`
        - `6 >= 3` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 3`
        - `7 >= 3` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 4`
        - `2 < 3` → `cnt` remains `4`
    - At the end of the loop, `cnt = 4` which is not equal to `x = 3`, so move to the next iteration.

5. **Iteration with `x = 4`**:
    - Initialize `cnt` to `0`.
    - Iterate over each element in `nums`:
        - `3 < 4` → `cnt` remains `0`
        - `5 >= 4` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 1`
        - `6 >= 4` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 2`
        - `7 >= 4` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 3`
        - `2 < 4` → `cnt` remains `3`
    - At the end of the loop, `cnt = 3` which is not equal to `x = 4`, so move to the next iteration.

6. **Iteration with `x = 5`**:
    - Initialize `cnt` to `0`.
    - Iterate over each element in `nums`:
        - `3 < 5` → `cnt` remains `0`
        - `5 >= 5` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 1`
        - `6 >= 5` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 2`
        - `7 >= 5` → `cnt++` → `cnt = 3`
        - `2 < 5` → `cnt` remains `3`
    - At the end of the loop, `cnt = 3` which is not equal to `x = 5`.

After all iterations, no value of `x` from `1` to `5` satisfied the condition `cnt == x`. Therefore, the method returns `-1`.

### Conclusion
For the array `nums = [3, 5, 6, 7, 2]`, there is no special integer `x` such that exactly `x` numbers in the array are greater than or equal to `x`. Hence, the method returns `-1`.
